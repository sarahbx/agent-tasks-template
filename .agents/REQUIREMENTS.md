# Token-Efficient Processing Protocol

All agents operating under this project must read and apply the [Token-Efficient Processing Protocol](TOKEN_PROTOCOL.md) before proceeding with any gate work. The protocol reduces token consumption in internal processing while preserving full quality in all user-facing output.

Read [TOKEN_PROTOCOL.md](TOKEN_PROTOCOL.md) now, then continue with the requirements below.

# Project Requirements

This file contains **non-negotiable, project-specific requirements**. They are not suggestions. They are not defaults that can be overridden by convenience or delivery pressure. Every agent reads this file. Every gate enforces it. Violations are REQUIRED findings that block gate advancement.

All agents read this file alongside `.agents/CYNEFIN.md`, `.agents/PERSONALITY.md`, and `.agents/LESSONS.md` before beginning any gate work.

Full requirement descriptions are in `.agents/requirements/`. Each file contains the requirement statement, rationale, scope, and enforcement rules.

## Updating This File

This file is maintained by the human stakeholder or principal architect. Changes require:
1. A new ADR documenting the change rationale (Gate 1)
2. Human approval at Gate 3 before the change takes effect
3. A note in `.agents/LESSONS.md` under Cross-Cutting lessons if the change reflects a learned pattern

Agents do not modify this file.
