# agent-tasks-template

A template repository that provides a structured set of tasks, skills, and commands for AI/LLM agents to process. Use this repo as a starting point for new projects that leverage AI-assisted software development workflows.

## Goals

This template provides a framework for AI/LLM agents to follow structured workflows when performing software engineering tasks. The included configuration defines:

- **Agent roles** with specialized responsibilities (architect, engineer, reviewer, etc.)
- **Pipelines** that define multi-gate processes (SDLC, Jira, Diagram Alignment) with human approval gates
- **Skills** that invoke pipelines from platform-specific entry points
- **Pre-commit hooks** with deterministic linting and AI-powered review (persona, diagram, SDLC)
- **Shared context** (personality, lessons learned, requirements) that agents load before each task
- **A Cynefin-based classification system** to match response strategy to problem complexity

## Platform Support

- **Claude Code** — fully supported via `.claude/` configuration
- **OpenCode** — fully supported via `.opencode/` configuration and `opencode.json`

## Quickstart
